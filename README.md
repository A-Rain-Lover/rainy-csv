# rainy-csv
A simple to use CSV manipulating library.

# Getting started
I found it somehow weired to make it compile to a `.a` file with only one file, so just compile `csv.c` in your project and that's it.
 * Check the `example.c` included in the repo
 * Check the <a href="https://computer-spectre.github.io/rainy-csv/html/csv_8h.html"> Docs </a>
